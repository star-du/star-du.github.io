1. operators that are somewhat different: `//` provides integer division, and will return an integer that is closest to it _yet lower_ (it's different when one of the numbers is float );   
`**`acts as 'raise to the power of';
```examples
>>> 11 // 2   
5    
>>> −11 // 2   
−6   
>>> 11.0 // 2   
5.0    
>>> 11 ** 2   
121
```
2. `fractions module.` can be import to calculate with fraction, To define a fraction, create a Fraction object and pass in the numerator and denominator;   
eg:`x = fractions.Fraction(1, 3)`
`math module`is also a helpful one to use constnts like **pi**;
