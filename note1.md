1. keyword function always goes after a none keyword argument.   
2. every function deserves a docstring, which must be the first thing destined
in a function.    
3. when importing a module, python looks in directories defined in
sys. path. By using ```sys.path.insert()``` you'll add a new directory,
 but the effect lasts as long as python is running     
4. indenting starts a block and unindenting ends it.    
5. traceback: if one function doesn't handle an exception,
it is passed to the calling function. if the exception is
never handled, your program will crash and Python will print
a _'traceback'_ to standard error.    
6. unlike `C`, python doesn't support inline assignment.
