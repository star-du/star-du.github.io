<h2>Dive into python 3 chapter 1</h2>
1. keyword function always goes after a none keyword argument.<br>
2. every function deserves a docstring, which must be the first thing destined
in a function.<br>
3. when importing a module, python looks in directories defined in
sys. path. By using <code>sys.path.insert()</code> you'll add a new directory,
 but the effect lasts as long as python is running<br>
4. indenting starts a block and unindenting ends it.<br>
5. traceback: if one function doesn't handle an exception,
it is passed to the calling function. if the exception is
never handled, your program will crash and Python will print
a <i>'traceback'</i> to standard error.<br>
6. unlike C, python doesn't support inline assignment.<br>
