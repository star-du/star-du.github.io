## How I started this blog #    
I've tried to take a record of things I learn and think about for literally a long time. It's such a pity that we get memories that are not reliable, we experience emotions that can hardly be passed on, and our human language is such a stale and incompetent piece of tool comparing to what flows in our mind.

So, for all things mentioned, I tried with a blog-like stuff to capture things I wish to <s>write</s> type down, up to now, I mainly concentrate on Python stuff and the book *Dive into Python*, and there might be other kinds of articles later on, like reviews or even just some mutterings of myself.

## Intro of GitHub Pages #
GitHub Pages uses a Markdown engine called <dfn>kramdown</dfn> for formatting text posts. kramdown is a superset of Markdown, meaning:

1. anything thatâ€™s valid Markdown is also valid kramdown, and
2. it provides and strictly specifies a number of features that are not available in Markdown.[^1]

Consult the official [kramdown syntax reference][kds] for an exhaustive list of features and how to use them.
